# push_swap2023

This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. 
To make this happen, we will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

The radix sort is the algorithm I've chosen to complete this task.
